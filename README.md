# SGCT-1.0

# This system was created for the Discipline of Systems Analysis and Design (Information Systems - Federal University of Santa Catarina), which I completed in 2020 (4th semester).

# The Management and Collection System (SGCT) is a console application designed to meet the growing demand for communication and problem resolution for taxpayers regarding accessibility to state services for the payment of state debts (CDA - Certificate of Outstanding Debt). The application offers a debt installment functionality, also generating bank slips for the payment of the installments.

# To log into the system as an Employee of the State, use the login: joao.dutra / password: joaodutra.
# To log in as an State Administrator permissions, use - login: admin / password: admin.
# To log in as a taxpayer or search by CPF (Brazilian Social Security Number), you can use any of the available CPFs in the database (Valeria’s is 03103103131, Antonio’s is 04104104141; both have several CDAs of different types registered).

# Uses Java Swing for graphical interface and forms, and Java Persistance as database for storing all entities (CDAs, Taxpayers, Users, etc.).
# Uses Caellum-Stella (https://github.com/caelum/caelum-stella) for generating bank slips for all types of payments.
