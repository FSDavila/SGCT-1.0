# SGCT-1.0

This system was created for the Discipline of Systems Analysis and Design (Information Systems - Federal University of Santa Catarina), which I completed in 2020 (4th semester).

The Management and Collection System (SGCT) is a console application designed to meet the growing demand for communication and problem resolution for taxpayers regarding accessibility to state services for the payment of state debts (CDA - Certificate of Outstanding Debt). The application offers a debt installment functionality, also generating bank slips for the payment of the installments.

To log into the system as an Employee of the State, use the login: joao.dutra / password: joaodutra.
To log in as an State Administrator permissions, use - login: admin / password: admin.
To log in as a taxpayer or search by CPF (Brazilian Social Security Number), you can use any of the available CPFs in the database (Valeria’s is 03103103131, Antonio’s is 04104104141; both have several CDAs of different types registered).
